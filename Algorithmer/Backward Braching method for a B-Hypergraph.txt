Backward Braching method for a B-Hypergraph using bitmap/array of booleans

Require valid ordering of the nodes {s, u_1, u_2,..., u_q = t}
function BACKWARDBRANCHING(H) 						// H is a hypergraph
	List B = Ã˜
	for i = q to 1 do								// Move from t to s O(V)
		Set all compound vertices to 1 				// All compound are usable O(V)
		Set all Reaction Vertices to 1 				// All compound are usable O(E)
		Set reaction u_i to 0						// remove the i'th edge	O(1)
		for j = q to i	do							// Fix the edges from t to u_i O(V)
			Set all reactions to compound u_j 
				not in pi to 0 except pi.u_j		// Makes all reaction into u_j unusable except the one from Shortest path. (FIXES)
				which is set to 1.
		end for
		B = B UNION {H^i}
	end for
	return B
end function
